## Data Sources Considered But Not Used {#sec-data-not-used}

### \acrlong{nmfs} Survey Indices

The \gls{s-wcgbt} and the \gls{s-tri} collect data off the California coast on rockfish biology and abundance and are commonly incorporated in West Coast groundfish assessments. The \gls{s-tri} operated between 1977--2004 and \gls{s-wcgbt} has operated since 2003. None of these fishery-independent surveys had adequate sample sizes of `r spp` off California to include as abundance indices for this assessment. There were no more than ten positive tows of `r spp` in any one year coastwide in the \gls{s-wcgbt}, and only seven positive tows in California. Similarly there were no more than five positive tows of `r spp` in any one year coastwide for the \gls{s-tri}, and only one positive tow in California. Given that indices of abundance were not calculated due to small sample sizes, length composition data from the \gls{s-wcgbt} (N = 39) and Triennial Survey (N = 1) off California were not included in the base model.

### Marine Recreational Fisheries Statistics Survey (MRFSS) Dockside Index 
We explored the potential to produce a fishery-dependent index of abundance using private/rental angler interview data. Samplers interviewed private/rental anglers at launch ramps and other onshore sites similar to today’s CRFS program run by \gls{cdfw}. Historic MRFSS records retained by \gls{cdfw} were used to combine angler and trip data (type 1) with sampler examined catch data (type 3). Type 1 data includes information about fishing mode, location, number of anglers, and their primary and secondary target species for the trip. Type 3 data provides catch information by species including the numbers of fish and their lengths. MRFSS samplers collected data on both observed and unobserved fish. Observed fish could be identified to species by the sampler and measured. Unobserved fish were reported by the angler but unavailable to the sampler for a variety of reasons. Because `r spp` may not be correctly identified by anglers, we used data only on observed fish. Additionally, using exclusively observed fish simplifies the calculation of effort (number of anglers) contributing to that catch. Data on observed and unobserved fish were collected on separate forms that lead to complications in accounting for all anglers contributing to a given vessel trip when adding the catch of observed and unobserved fish. The first angler interviewed has been referred to as the “leader” and all subsequent anglers as “followers”. Combining type 1 and type 3 data accounts for all observed fish caught by leaders and followers. We also included only trips with fishing effort and complete interviews.

We further filtered this dataset to include trips more likely to catch `r spp` and therefore better represent possible `r spp` effort. Two fishing location fields were used to exclude inland waters such as bays and estuaries. We excluded southern California counties where `r spp` is rare. The time of year was organized into two-month “waves”, and we excluded the first wave representing January and February. Fishing for rockfish was prohibited in these months in 2003 for some central and northern California districts. We included only trips with angler reported primary targets of bottomfish and rockfish which also excluded years between 1980 to 1992 when species target data was not collected. Finally, we removed a trip in 1993 with an outlier catch of 120 `r spp`. While these filters reduced the overall number of samples by an order of magnitude, `r spp` remained rare with only about 2.9% positive samples. The index was ultimately not included in the model due to the very low proportion of samples with `r spp`, and very large resulting standard deviations around the average \gls{cpue}, which provided little contrast across the time series. 

### Deb Wilson-Vandenberg Survey Index
The Deb Wilson-Vandenberg survey has been used to develop an index of abundance for previous nearshore stock assessments. The survey effort was focused around the San Francisco Bay area and did encounter `r spp`. The length information is used to inform the length composition of the recreational fleet, but the index was not representative of the assessment area. The majority of `r spp` encountered in the survey were from in and around the Farallon Islands and Cordell Bank, both areas that now have large closed areas. 

### Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) Logbook Index
Paper logbooks from the \gls{cpfv}, i.e. the party/charter mode, as collected by \gls{cdfw} in their current form began to be used in 1980. This dataset contains individual trip records with information reported by the vessel captain including numbers of fish by species or species group, the port of landing, the 10x10 nautical mile fishing block and depth where the majority of fishing occurred, the number of contributing anglers, and the number of hours spent actively fishing, among other fields. Captains are required to submit a logbook for each trip and compliance rates have varied over time. In 2017, captains were provided with the option to use an electronic logbook, though the paper logbook is still acceptable. Paper logs are limited in species specific fields. Rockfish are either enumerated in a rockfish genus field that is not species-specific or individual species can be noted using a write-in field. Most rockfish are not speciated on the paper log. The electronic log allows for a greater number of species selections using pull-down menus. A general genus category for rockfish also exists in the electronic log and identification to species is not legally required. We explored this data for its potential to produce an index of abundance or to inform our understanding of party/charter effort and fishing dynamics over time in the context of `r spp`.

We filtered the data to focus on trips most relevant to `r spp`. We excluded trips south of Point Conception where `r spp` are rare by excluding fishing blocks numbered greater than 650, and trips occurring between January and March when fishing for rockfish is prohibited. We included only trips where their target was noted as rockfish and only single day trips. Multi-day trips typically target highly migratory species. `r Spp` remained rare following these filters with approximately 0.3% of trips catching `r spp`. This was deemed insufficient for production of an index.

### International Pacific Halibut Commission (IPHC) Fishery-Independent Setline Survey (FISS) Index
The \gls{iphc} \gls{fiss} is designed to provide catch and biological information on Pacific halibut but does retain records on non-target species. The survey is focused in Alaska and British Columbia and does not frequently extend into California waters, however \gls{cdfw} is aware of 22 `r spp` caught in 2014 and five in 2017 in California waters. Age data are available for the five fish from 2017. These data were considered insufficient for inclusion as an index and in length and age compositions, and ages were only included in the initial external estimate of growth.

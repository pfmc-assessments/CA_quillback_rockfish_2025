### Key Assumptions and Structural Choices (TOR section F1 and E6) {#sec-structure}

The base assessment model for `r spp` was developed to balance parsimony and realism, with the goal of estimating a spawning output trajectory for the population of `r spp` off California. The base model represents a balance among the number of model parameters, the model fits to data, and minimizing the negative log-likelihood, as well as accurately representing fishery dynamics and `r spp` biology. The model contains many assumptions to achieve parsimony and uses many different sources of data, including new sources, to estimate reality.

Model specifications were informed by discussions with the \gls{pfmc}'s \gls{gmt} and \gls{gap} advisers and through comments and discussion during the [pre-assessment workshop](https://tinyurl.com/janpfmc2025). Choices related to model structure included a discussion of fleet structure, potential time blocks for selectivity parameters, the potential ability to estimate growth within the model. Data related choices on maximum age that is used to estimate natural mortality, and acknowledgement of years with high estimated catch were also discussed. These topics and more were explored through a series of investigative model runs to achieve the final base model, either through the bridging analysis (see @sec-bridging), by profiles (see @sec-profiles), or through sensitivity analysis (see @sec-assmt-sens).

The specifications of the assessment are listed in [@tbl-model-config]. Growth and natural mortality are assumed time- and sex-invariant. Population age and length structure is modeled from age 0 (recruitment age) to an accumulator age (plus group) of 80 in 1 year age bins, and from 4 cm (assumed size at birth at the beginning of the year) to an accumulator bin of 59 cm in 1 cm length bins. Data were binned in 1 year increments from 1 to 60 years for age, and in 2 cm increments from 10 to 50 cm for length. Growth is modeled using the Schnute parameterization of von Bertalanffy growth, with two estimated length parameters ($L_{age=1}$ and $L_{\infty}$), estimated CV for each length parameter, and a growth rate coefficient ($K$). Growth is assumed to be the same for males and females in this assessment. Year-class strength is estimated as deviations from a Beverton-Holt stock-recruitment relationship, with deviations estimated between 1940--2024 with a fixed $\sigma_R$ value of 0.5.  

As described in the fishery-dependent data section (see @sec-fish-dep) age-frequency data from the commercial fleet and across many sources for the growth fleet were compiled as conditional age-at-length distributions by year. This approach has several benefits for analysis above the use of marginal age compositions. First, age structures are generally collected as a subset of the fish that have been measured. If the ages are to be used to create an external age-length key to transform the lengths to ages, then the uncertainty due to sampling and missing data in the key are not included in the resulting age-compositions used in the stock assessment. The second major benefit to using conditional age-composition observations is that in addition to being able to estimate the basic growth parameters inside the assessment model, the distribution of lengths at a given age that is usually controlled by the CV of length at some young age and the CV at a much older age, are also more reliably estimated. This information could only be derived from marginal age-composition observations where very strong and well-separated cohorts existed, and that are quite accurately aged and measured; rare conditions at best. By fully estimating the growth specifications within the stock assessment model, bias due to size-based selectivity and length-stratified ageing is avoided, and known sources of variation are included when estimating growth parameters.

Within-lab ageing error was based on one primary age reader and a second reader producing double reads from 418 otoliths collected from California (@fig-age_error). An ageing error estimate was made based on these double reads using an ADMB computational tool specifically developed for estimating ageing error [@punt_quantifying_2008] and using release 1.3.1 of the R package \href{https://github.com/pfmc-assessments/nwfscAgeingError}{nwfscAgeingError} [@thorson_nwfscageingerror_2012] for input and output diagnostics. A series of 24 ageing error models were run to look across the suite of bias and ageing precision. The model selected by AIC (and used in the assessment) assumes the first reader was unbiased and a constanct coefficient of variation, i.e., sigma is a linear function of true age.

### Model Parameters (TOR Section E6 and F1)

There are `r dplyr::filter(mod_out$parameters, Phase > 0) |> nrow()` estimated parameters in the base model. Estimated parameters include one parameter for ln($R_0$), 5 parameters for growth, 97 recruitment parameters, 3 survey catchability parameters, and 15 selectivity parameters (@tbl-n-param). Early recruitment deviations are estimated starting in 1940, while main period recruitment deviations begin in 1978, shortly before the majority of length composition data become available, and end in 2021. Late recruitment deviations are estimated 2022--2024, and although forecast recruitment deviation parameters are included in @tbl-n-param, they were set to follow the stock-recruit curve. 

Parameters were estimated using maximum likelihood estimation and uncertainty is based on the assumption of asymptotic multivariate normality of the maximum likelihood
estimate, where the variance-covariance matrix is the inverse of the hessian matrix. Exploratory MCMC runs indicated that posterior distributions largely matched the
asymptotic distributions, but took much longer to produce. The parameter where the
posterior distribution diverged the most from the maximum likelihood was the descending
slope of selectivity for the first commercial block, where the MLE corresponded to a
declining (i.e. domed) selectivity shape. The posterior mode matched the MLE, but a larger fraction of the posterior samples were from higher values corresponding to more of an asymptotic shape.

A number of parameters were fixed in the model. Steepness was fixed at 0.72, the mean of the prior. Natural mortality was fixed at 0.068 $yr^{-1}$, the median of the prior as determined by the maximum age. Other biological parameters were also fixed, as described in the biology section (see @sec-biology), and include the two weight-length parameters, two maturity parameters, and two fecundity parameters. The assumed fraction of females in the population was also fixed, and assumed to be 0.5. The standard deviation of recruitment deviation $\sigma_R$ was fixed at 0.6.

#### Priors and Constraints on Parameters 

Priors were used to determine fixed parameter values for natural mortality and steepness in the base model. The prior distribution for natural mortality was based on the @hamel_development_2022 meta-analytic approach with an assumed maximum age of 80 years. The prior assumed a log-normal distribution for natural mortality with a log-standard deviation of 0.31. The prior for steepness assumed a beta distribution with standard deviation of 0.16, as specified by the \gls{pfmc} \gls{tor}. Although there parameters were fixed in the base model, the likelihood component of the priors was included in the final likelihood.

Length and conditional-age-at-length samples are all assumed to follow a multinomial sampling distribution, where the sample size is fixed at the input sample size for the composition data (see @sec-fish-dep). Input sample size is subsequently weighted to account for additional sources of over-dispersion according to the Francis method using three iterations [[@francis_data_2011]; @tbl-compweight]. Each of the survey data sources are assumed to follow a log-normal distribution with standard error provided as input for each index. Total removals are also assumed to follow a log-normal distribution and were given a fixed value of log-standard deviation of 0.05. 

Recruitment deviations during the main period were constrained to sum to zero. Relaxing this assumption showed some variation in the model, however, later explorations during sensitivities showed this be due to the timing of when main recruitment deviations start (see @sec-assmt-sens) and not due to the sum-to-one constraint. Given this, and because the constraint allows for clearer interpretation of management reference points, we keep it in the base model. 


#### Selectivity Assumptions  

Selectivity reflects the capabilities of the gear as well as a variety of other combined fishing and ecosystem dynamics that determine what sized fish a fleet has access to. All selectivity was assumed to be length-based and initially explored as a three parameter double-normal functional form (length at peak selectivity, and ascending and descending limbs). While the double-normal functional form was used initially, early explorations indicated that asymptotic selectivity was more parsimonious for all but the first time block for the commercial fleet, and therefore an asymptotic functional form was assumed for the majority of fleets by fixing the descending limb parameter at a high value. Selectivity of the growth fleet, which is used to inform estimates of growth and not selectivity, was set at one for all lengths. 

Time blocks on selectivity and selectivity forms were explored extensively when setting up the initial model structure, as well as in sensitivities (see @sec-assmt-sens). California's fisheries are managed with depth and spatial restrictions that likely influence selectivity. For `r spp`, we find that larger fish are present at all depths and smaller fish more commonly present in the shallower depths. This is evident in the ROV data and was also observed in British Columbia waters by @murie_comparative_1991. 

Time-varying selectivity was applied to both the commercial and recreational fleets. Assumptions for the shapes of curves and timing of blocks was driven by a combination of model fits, parsimony, and knowledge of fishery and regulatory dynamics over time. Four time blocks for the commercial fleet allowed separate selectivity parameterizations during the periods 1916--2002, 2003--2013, 2014--2021, and 2022--2024, although the second and final periods mirrored to one another based on similar estimated parameters when allowed to be separate. The first time block is allowed to be dome shaped, whereas all other blocks assumed asymptotic selectivity. Dome-shaped selectivity was allowed initially for these later time block, but did not improve model fit sufficiently to warrant the extra parameters. The early time period is inclusive of the 1980s and 1990s when the live rockfish fishery was most active and may have been targeting intermediate-sized fish. The periods between 2003--2013 and 2022--2024 were times of fishery restriction (@fig-com-regs-vis). A variety of new depth limits, trip limits, and permit structures were implemented around 2003. Trip limits were markedly reduced in 2022 and further limits specific to `r spp` occurred in 2023 and 2024.  These periods are parameterized as asymptotic curves with a peak at relatively small sized fish that is similar to the peak of the early 1916--2002 period. In contrast, the 2014-2021 period corresponds to modest increases in trip limits and allowable fishing depths. This may have provided greater access to deeper waters where larger fish are prevalent, thus shifting the asymptotic curve's peak to the right. 

Two time periods were estimated for the recreational fleet in the base model. These were 1928--2016 and 2017--2024. However early explorations included more blocks: 1928--2000, 2001--2016, 2017--2022, and 2023--2024. Dome-shaped selectivity was allowed initially all time blocks, but did not improve model fit sufficiently to warrant the extra parameters. During the period of 2000 to 2003, recreational depth and season restrictions were implemented for nearshore rockfish for the first time in California (@fig-rec-regs-vis). However, explorations of time blocks before and after that period did not result in meaningfully different selectivity curves and we therefore combined the blocks before and after those regulatory changes. Although a relaxation of early 2000 depth restrictions started in 2017, and increased restrictions on harvest and retention of `r spp` started in 2023, which were the reasons for the initial blocking structure, model explorations did not result in meaningfully different selectivity curves, and we therefore combined the blocks after 2017. The asymptotic peak for the initial block is shifted to the left towards smaller fish, possibly corresponding to fishing dynamics in the very early years with anglers remaining relatively close to shore by choice or due to vessel capacity, as well as later years when they were restricted closer to shore by regulation. In contrast, the next block representing 2017--2024 is shifted to the right representing larger fish as most years during this period correspond to a period of regulatory relaxation.  

Constant asymptotic selectivity was used for both survey fleets. The peak corresponds to selection of smaller fish for the \gls{s-ccfrp} survey relative to the \gls{rov} survey however the ascending limb represents as smaller range of sizes observed in the \gls{rov} survey compared to \gls{s-ccfrp}. This is consistent with differences in survey depths with \gls{s-ccfrp} operating to only 60 m depth and \gls{rov} extending as deep as 100 m. The \gls{rov} is expected to see smaller fish present that may not be caught with the hook size used in the CCFRP survey.

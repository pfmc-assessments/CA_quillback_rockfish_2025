# Appendix C: Regulations History

The following figures represent the regulations history for California's saltwater recreational fishery and nearshore commercial fishery that affect `r spp`.

A visualization of the California recreational regulatory history relevant to quillback rockfish is in [@fig-rec-regs-vis]. The recreational regions are defined based on the following latitudes: Northern ($42^\circ 00^\prime$ N. Lat. to $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. Lat.), Mendocino ($40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. Lat. to $38^\circ 57^\prime$ N. Lat.), San Francisco ($38^\circ 57^\prime$ N. Lat. to $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N. Lat.), Central ($37^\circ 11^\prime$ N. Lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. Lat.), Southern ($34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. Lat. to US/Mexico border). Not all management areas have been consistently defined over time. The northern and southern management areas have remained the same. From 2001-2003 the Central management area was defined as $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. Lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. Lat. In 2004 and again in 2024, the Central area was split into a North-Central and South-Central areas at $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N. Lat. In 2005, the regions from  $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. Lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. Lat. were redefined. The North-Central encompasses $40^\circ 10^\prime$ N. Lat. to $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N. Lat., Monterey South-Central from $37^\circ 11^\prime$ N. Lat. to $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N. Lat., and Morro Bay South-Central from $36^\circ 00^\prime$ N. Lat. to $34^\circ 27^\prime$ N. Lat.

A visualization of the California commercial regulatory history relevant to quillback rockfish between the years 2000 and 2023 is in @fig-com-regs-vis.  Prior to 2003 nearshore trip limits were different for \gls{lefg} and \gls{oa} sectors, and cells prior to 2003 in figure [@fig-com-regs-vis] are representative of the OA sector. In 2003, trip limits became equivalent for the OA and LEFG sectors. In 2003 CDFW began the limited entry deeper nearshore permit program which capped participants at 280 and the number of permits has declined each year following. Trip limits prior to 2022 were a culmination of all nearshore rockfish species, meaning although the theoretical quillback rockfish maximum is the trip limit, the limit applies to all deeper nearshore species combined during that period and it is likely `r spp` were a small fraction of that period limit. Limits specific to quillback rockfish were implemented in 2023.

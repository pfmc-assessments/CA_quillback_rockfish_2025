Ecosystem and environmental conditions,Assessment data inputs,Assessment model fits and structural uncertainty
• There is limited information on factors affecting ,• Catch reconstruction has uncertainty in some historical years due to periods of high and low estimates of sampled catch rates and when rockfish were not always sorted to species,• Recruitment and growth are estimated internally whereas natural mortality and steepness are based on priors. 
" quillback recruitment, habitat, prey and predators, and",• Not captured in bottom trawl surveys. Indices based on fishery-dependent and other fishery-independent sources. Limited effect on population trends. ,• Profiles and jitters indicate the model is stable and that estimated parameters are genearlly well estimated. 
competitors.,• Age data is limited compared to some other groundfish species and primarily occurs in the most recent 5-10 years. Covers commercial sector and suitable for growth estimation. Young fish remain sparse.,• Uncertainty in natural mortality estimates both in terms of uncertainty in longevity as well as limited information by which to clearly estimate value.
,• Fewer samples of length data from fishing in recent years due to non-retention,"• Uncertainty in recruitment, particularly the strength of recruitment deviations in the mid 1990s."
,• Length and age data are generally fit well across many assumptions. ,• Patterns of retrospective bias due to exclusion of age data over time.
,• Species-specific maturity and fecundity with both being collected from most recent years,• Composition and index data were generally well fit. 
,• Generally not a directly targeted species but most catch is landed.,• Data were insufficient to evaluate spatiotemporal variation in biology.

Variable,Description
SurveyYear,Year in which the actual survey occurred. 
SuperYear,Survey coverages are completed over three years resulting in compilation to 2015 (2014-2016) and 2020 (2019-2021). Treated as a categorical factor. 
MPAGroup,MPA name that identifies records from MPA sites and associated reference areas. 
Site,CDFW and MARE historical site code. A site generally designates a 500 meter wide rectangle with varying length and depth range. May be preferable to use MPA Group given spatial proximate of sites within a group and scale of spatial autocorrelation. Number of transects may not be equal between sites.
Avg_Latitude,Average of longitudinal positions within a transect.
Latitude Squared,The Square of the Avg_Latitude within a transect.
Avg_Longitude,Average of latitudinal positions within a transect. 
Avg_Depth,Average depth in meters recorded within a transect. 
Depth Squared,Average depth squared was calculated by squaring the Avg_Depth values after scaling so that these values were also centered on the mean.
PropHard,The proportion of hard usable habitat along a transect. 
PropMixed,The proportion of mixed usable habitat along a transect.
PropHardMixed,The proportion of hard or mixed usable habitat along a transect. 
Protection,Whether the segment in question is in a no take closed Marine Protected Area (1) or open to fishing (0).  Treated as a categorical factor. 
ProtectionYrs,The number of years the site has been protected since implementation in the survey year.
Portdistance,Distance in meters from nearest port to the centroid coordinates of the sub-unit. Derived from port distance raster layer provided by Becky Miller (SWFSC).
Quillback Rockfish,Total number of quillback rockfish individuals counted within sub-unit.
Usable_Area_Fish,"Summed two dimensional area (m^2) of all microframes (one second of ROV area swept) within a sub-unit determined by multiplying Total_XYdist with estimated width at horizontal center of video frame for each microframe, where video parameters are within useable parameters."

### Total Removals {#sec-removals}

Removals (1916--2024) for `r spp` were compiled from multiple data sources. This assessment uses total removals (landings plus dead discards) for all fishing fleets. Sources for total removals are described below. In instances where separate data sources were used for landings and dead discards, each component is described separately. The values for total removals used in the base model are provided in @tbl-catches and @fig-catches.

#### Commercial Landings and Discards

Commercial landings for `r spp` were combined into a single fleet by aggregating across gear types (nearly all hook and line, either as longline or pole gears) and fish landed live versus dead. This choice was based on similarities in the length distributions among gear types and between fish landed live versus dead within \gls{pacfin} samples in areas and years of overlap.

Commercial landings data were available from 1916--2024. Historical landings (1916--1968) were obtained from the California Catch Reconstruction Project [@ralston_documentation_2010]. The reconstruction covered all of California, but only the northern port groups of Crescent City, Eureka, and Fort Bragg had landings for `r spp`. Additional landings caught off the coast of Oregon or Washington but landed in California for 1948--1968 were added to the reconstruction to represent total landings at California ports. These additional landings were small in magnitude; no more than 0.08 mt was landed in any one year and approximately 0.3 mt was landed across all years. Landings for 1969--1980 came from \gls{calcom}, and were negligible for `r spp`.

Recent (1981--2024) landings were obtained from \gls{pacfin} (extracted 03/14/2025). There were no landings for `r spp` within \gls{pacfin} for the years 1981--1983, and 1985. Sampling occurred during these years, and so estimates of zero were not due to a lack of sampling. Given that landings in the immediate preceding years were negligible, we kept landings for `r spp` in these years at zero, rather than interpolate between years. These years of low landings were immediately followed by an estimate of high landings in 1991 which is the result of procedures used by \gls{calcom} to attribute species-specific landings samples to larger, unsampled landings quantities. 

Commercial discard data for `r spp` are collected through the \gls{noaa}'s \gls{wcgop}. Estimates of dead discards in 2002--2023 for each sector of the commercial fleet are provided in the \gls{gemm} product [@somers_gemm_2023, and [publicly available](https://connect.fisheries.noaa.gov/gemm_csv/)]. Dead discards from the \gls{gemm} product for California `r spp` were added to landings estimates from \gls{pacfin} to obtain total removals for 2002--2023. Biological samples of `r spp` discards from \gls{wcgop} were available from 2004--2022, but were very sparse for all years other than 2022. As there was limited information with which to estimate selectivity of the discards over the majority of years, we added dead discards to landings and used total removals as the catch stream in the model.

Total removals prior to 2002, for which no \gls{wcgop} data are available, were calculated based on assuming an average ratio of dead discards to landings (0.25%), based on \gls{wcgop} data from the nearshore sector in 2002--2021. The nearshore sector was selected as it most likely represents expected fishery behavior prior to 2002, and data from 2002 to 2021 were used because the ratio of dead discards increased in 2022 and 2023, likely as a consequence of management changes to the fishery. Preliminary estimates of dead discards for 2024 were provided by the \gls{nwfsc} \gls{fos} program on 3/31/2025 and added to landings in that year to obtain total removals for 2024.

#### Recreational Landings and Discards

Recreational removals for `r spp` were combined across private/rental and party/charter modes, which both use hook-and-line gear. This choice was based on similarities in the length distributions between these fishing modes within \gls{recfin} samples in areas where both occurred.

Recreational landings data were available from 1928--2024. Historical landings (1928--1980) were obtained from the California Catch Reconstruction Project [@ralston_documentation_2010]. Since 1980, recreational data sources provide estimates of total removals, which combine landings and dead discards. Data during these years were obtained from the \gls{mrfss} (1980--2004; extracted 10/17/2024) and \gls{crfs} (2005--2024; extracted 1/24/2025) datasets via the \gls{recfin} website. While the \gls{mrfss} dataset includes data from 2004, samples in this year were collected by the \gls{crfs} sampling program. Although the \gls{mrfss} sampling program also includes removals for 1980, landings from the historical reconstruction were preferred for 1980. This is because @ralston_documentation_2010 considered their 1980 estimate to be more reliable than that of \gls{mrfss}, and likely survey quality problems related to 1980 being the first year of \gls{mrfss} [@Karpov1995; @cope_status_2009]. 

Estimates of dead discards for the historical years (1928--1980) were calculated based on an average ratio of dead discards to landings (1.1%) from \gls{mrfss} data across all years 1980--2004. A direct breakdown of the landed and dead discarded fish by weight was not available within the \gls{mrfss} data, so the discard ratio was derived by dividing the number of fish discarded dead (not available to be observed by the sampler) by the total number discarded and retained (\gls{mrfss} column ESTHARV divided by the sum of columns ESTHARV and ESTCLAIM). Landings and dead discards for the historical years were then added together to obtain estimates of total removals.

A number of years with missing or incomplete estimates for recreational total removals were interpolated by the \gls{stat} with guidance from \gls{cdfw}. First, 207 \gls{crfs} catch records in \gls{recfin} between 2014--2022 had a zero estimate for dead discards by weight but not by number. Total removals were based on weight, so to ensure these records with zero weight were included, an average weight per fish for dead discards was calculated from records with both weight and number, and used to derive estimates of dead discards in weight. Filling in these gaps increased the estimated total removals from between 0.02 mt to at most 1.2 mt in any one year. Second, the \gls{mrfss} sampling program did not sample between 1990--1992, and did not sample party/charter vessels north of San Luis Obispo between 1993--1995. Estimates for the party/charter mode in 1993--1995 were calculated as the average of party/charter removals among \gls{mrfss} years (1980--2004) and then added to the private/rental estimates in 1993--1995 to obtain total removals for those years. Estimates of total removals for both the private/rental and party/charter modes in 1990--1992 were obtained as averages from neighboring years. Total removals in 1990 was estimated as the average of total removals from 1987--1989, total removals in 1991 as the average from 1987--1989 and 1993--1995, and total removals in 1992 as the average from 1993--1995. The estimate of total removals in 1993 was one of the largest for the recreational fleet across all years, and so the effects of assuming an average catch in 1991 and 1992 based on the 1993 estimate was explored as a sensitivity analysis (see @sec-assmt-sens).

The COVID-19 pandemic impacted \gls{cdfw} \gls{crfs} sampling in 2020 and 2021. No sampling occurred at all from April-June, 2020. \Gls{cdfw} provided proxy values for these months (M. Parker, CDFW, pers. comm., 12/4/2024). Total proxy values for `r spp` in weight were summed across districts and added to the existing estimate for 2020 from \gls{recfin}. In addition, California recreational total mortality estimates in the “rockfish genus” category were inflated due to \gls{crfs} samplers being unable to closely examine catch and identify catch to species. This was a problem for both private/rental and party/charter modes in 2020 and primarily for the party/charter mode in 2021. Some of the rockfish genus mortality was reallocated to other rockfish species for these modes and years and provided by \gls{cdfw} (provided on 12/5/24). An expected value of rockfish genus mortality in 2020 and 2021 was generated by mode and year according to the average proportion to the total rockfish mortality that this category represented in 2018 and 2019, when regulations were consistent with 2020 and 2021. Mortality above this expected value was attributed to the other species also based on proportions each species represented to the total from 2018 and 2019. Calculations were made by year, mode, and district. The shore-based modes were grouped in with the private/rental mode. Calculations were initially made in numbers of fish because rockfish genus mortality is only recorded this way. Numbers of fish by species were then converted to weight in kilograms based on average weights of fish recorded by the \gls{crfs} program by district in 2019. Total reallocated values for `r spp` weight were summed across modes and districts and added to existing estimates, which for 2020 was the sum of the proxy value and the estimate from \gls{recfin}, and for 2021 was the estimate from \gls{recfin}.


### Composition Data

Sampling programs to determine species compositions of commercially landed catches began in the late 1960s but the first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity) began in 1980. Currently, port biologists employed by \gls{psmfc} with the \gls{ccgs} collect species composition information and biological data from the landed catches of commercial vessels that have completed their fishing trips. The monitoring programs currently in place are generally based on stratified, multistage sampling designs.

The biological characteristics of recreational landings were not consistently sampled for scientific purposes until the late 1970s, although a few studies occurred as early as the late 1950s. The first rigorous monitoring programs that included routine collection of biological data (e.g., sex, age, size, maturity states) began in 1980 by the national \gls{mrfss} program under the \gls{psmfc} and by state sampling programs. State sampling programs replaced \gls{mrfss} in the 2003--2004 period to better support in season management. Currently, port biologists employed by \gls{cdfw} collect catch, effort, and biological data from the landed catches of recreational vessels that have completed their fishing trips. Onboard sampling also occurs on party/charter vessels.

Twenty-one bins from 10 to 50 cm (2 cm bin size) were used to summarize the length frequency distributions for sources of removals. The first bin includes all observations less than 10 cm and the last bin includes all fish larger than 50 cm. Sixty bins from age 1 to age 60 (1 year bin size) were used to summarize the available age distributions. These ranges encapsulate all ages sampled. Conditional-age-at-length data were used for age compositions, and are described in more detail in @sec-structure. Age data used in the model were from break-and-burn otolith reads, as aged by the \gls{cap} lab in Newport, Oregon. 

Length samples were nearly entirely unsexed, while all age samples included information on sex. Given the limited information in the literature of sexual dimorphism for `r spp` [@LenarzandEcheverria_dimorphism_1991], and that the majority of lengths were unsexed, length frequency compositions were calculated combined across sexes and unsexed fish.

#### Commercial Length and Age Composition

The \gls{ccgs} is the only fishery-dependent sampling program that collects otoliths as part of the sampling design. Length and age samples were collected from commercial landings and extracted from \gls{pacfin} (extracted 03/17/2025). Length samples were available starting in 1978, but were very sparse prior to 1991. Lengths were most numerous during the 1990s, and since 2002 the number of length samples has been relatively low. Age samples were available starting in 2007, but only included one fish in 2011 and four in 2012 until being consistently available starting in 2019. Length and age compositions were combined across gear types based on similarities in length distributions among gears in areas where they both occurred.

The length observations were expanded to the sampled cluster level, to account for any fish that were not measured, then to the trip level to account for the relative size of the landing from which the sample was obtained. These expanded length observations were then combined within a year and used for the base model.

The input sample sizes for the expanded commercial length data were calculated via the Stewart Method (I. Stewart, pers. comm., IPHC, and developed at NWFSC) based on a combination of the number of trips and fish by year:

 <!-- {{< pagebreak >}} <!-- Comment out if do letter size formatting -->

```{=tex}
\begin{centering}

Input effN = $N_{\text{trips}} + 0.138 * N_{\text{fish}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}< 44$

Input effN = $7.06 * N_{\text{trips}}$ if $N_{\text{fish}}/N_{\text{trips}}\geq 44$

\end{centering}
```

This same calculation was also used for age composition data when marginal distributions were used, but that was only done as a sensitivity (see @sec-assmt-sens). For the base model, conditional-age-at-length distributions were used and sample sizes were based on the total number of age samples.

The magnitude of sampling for lengths and ages from the commercial fleet each year is given in @tbl-comm_lengths and @tbl-comm_ages. These tables show both the total number of fish sampled as well as the number of trips by year over which samples were obtained. @tbl-comm_lengths also shows the sample size for expanded length compositions as used in the base model, which was calculated using the formula above. Sparse length and age composition data occurred in several years. Years where sample size for expanded length compositions were less than or equal to five, and years with fewer than 30 samples for conditional-age-at-length were excluded from the base model during fitting. Implications of these choices were tested as a sensitivity (see @sec-assmt-sens).

Commercial length and age frequency distributions are shown in @fig-len-comm-bubbles--@fig-caal-comm. Commercial lengths initially covered a relatively broad range of sizes, approximately 20 cm to near 50 cm in 1991--2002 (@fig-len-comm-bubbles). Since 2003, the range of observed sizes has shifted away from smaller sizes, from around 30 cm to near 50 cm. This shift in observed sizes is also reflected in the mean lengths observed by year, which have increased from around 33 cm to around 43 cm between 2000--2016 (@fig-lenMean-comm). The shift in mean size could be due to shifts in fishery behavior, market demand, sampling (there was a shift to more northern port groups during the mid 2000s and early 2010s), changes in the population demographics (e.g., lack of recruitment or presence of a dominant recruitment pulse), and likely a combination of multiple factors. Commercial ages cover a narrow period of years and ages range from around 5 to 45 years old (@fig-caal-comm). The range of age at a given length can be broad, and varies by age. Given the limited timeframe over which ages were sampled, patterns of cohorts are not easily discernible.

#### Recreational Length Composition

Recreational length composition data were obtained from a variety of sources. The primary sources of length samples were obtained from the \gls{mrfss} sampling program for years 1980--2003 and from the \gls{crfs} sampling program for years 2004--2024 via the \gls{recfin} website (extracted on 11/22/2024 for \gls{mrfss} and 3/14/2025 for \gls{crfs}). Samples with lengths greater than 60 cm (N = 3) and from shore-based and beach-bank modes (N = 6) and using spear gear (N = 2) were not considered representative and so were excluded. Lengths of fish measured by samplers onboard vessels prior to being released (type 3d data; N = 49) were included among the data extracted from the \gls{crfs} sampling program. California has no aged samples of `r spp` available from recreational sampling within \gls{recfin}, and so only length composition data were used to represent recreational landings.

Age data that could represent the recreational fleet included age samples from \gls{cdfw} for the private/rental mode and cooperative research samples from \gls{swfsc} for the party/charter mode. However, the length distributions were not similar to those in \gls{recfin} from the same time period and not all programs had sufficient sample sizes. Therefore, these ages were not included in the base model, but were used to inform initial parameters of growth (i.e. external estimates of growth; see @sec-growth for details). 

Lengths sampled from the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard party/charter observer survey for 1987--1998 were obtained from the \gls{swfsc} [@reilly_onboard_1998; @Monk_Debsurvey_2016]. Between 1987--1989 and 1993--1998 there were recreational length data for the party/charter mode from both \gls{mrfss} and the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data sets. During data exploration it was determined that the lengths in \gls{mrfss} from 1997 and 1998 were collected as part of Deb Wilson-Vandenberg's survey, indicating that these data sources were duplicated for at least these years. In order to avoid known duplicate data for 1997--1998, length data from the \gls{mrfss} sampling program for party/charter mode in these years (N = 123) were excluded from the base model.

Length samples collected from a sampling survey in 1992--1998 by \gls{cdfw} were obtained from online reports [@geibel_prsurvey_2025, extracted on 1/8/2025]. These lengths were limited to a single northern district (Redwood), and were sampled from private/rental vessels only. While limited in spatial scale, these data were collected as part of a robust survey design separate from other sampling programs. This study also represents a large sample size (n = 600), and provides information on a fishing mode not covered by the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data. The data therefore were included in the length compositions for the base model.

Lastly, historical data were available from two additional sources. A dockside sampling effort was undertaken by CDFW during the 1950s--1970s to collect data from the private/rental and party/charter modes. Data collected from 1958 to 1972 was from Miller and Gotschall [@miller_ocean_1965] and Miller and Geibel [@miller1973fish], however samples of `r spp` were only available for 1959--1960. Within these years, 45 `r spp` lengths were collected from party/charter vessels and 45 from private/rental vessels. While limited in sample size, these data cover the central to northern districts and represent the only data from this time period, and so these data were included in length compositions for the base model.

The approach to determine the input sample sizes for the recreational length data varied by data source. Some data sources had unique trip numbers within the data such as the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg data and the \gls{mrfss} sampling program. For other data sources that lacked a clear trip identifier we used combinations of multiple fields to attempt to estimate unique combinations that represented the number of trips sampled. In general, the number of trips was estimated based on a combination of time, location, and fishery type. The number of trips for length compositions from the \gls{crfs} sampling program was estimated using sampling date, sampling site (\gls{recfin} columns COUNTY_NUMBER and INTERVIEW_SITE), fishing area, and mode. The number of trips from @geibel_prsurvey_2025 was estimated using sampling date and sampling port. The number of trips from @miller_ocean_1965 was estimated using sampling year and month, sampling port, and mode. The number of trips from @miller1973fish was estimated using sampling year, sampling county, and mode. Collectively, the estimates for the number of trips are meant to represent a reasonable starting point that generally reflects the degree of similarity of information from sampling a given number of likely similar fish within any sampling event.

The magnitude of sampling for lengths from the recreational fleet each year is given in @tbl-rec_lengths, which shows the different sampling frequencies employed over different time periods. This table shows both the total number of fish sampled as well as the number of assumed trips by year over which samples were obtained. The highest number of samples has occurred in years since 2004. As was applied for commercial composition data, years where sample size for length compositions were less than or equal to five were excluded from the model during development. Implications of this choice were tested as a sensitivity (see @sec-assmt-sens). Across all recreational data sources, length frequency data were aggregated across party/charter and private/rental modes based on similarities in length distributions in areas where they both occurred.

The recreational length frequency distribution is shown in @fig-len-rec-bubbles. The recreational fleet catches slightly smaller fish on average relative to the commercial fleet, but encounters a wider range of sizes, possibly due to the lack of size preference for the recreational fleet and the inclusion of released fish lengths. The distribution of lengths of `r spp` observed by the recreational fleet has generally ranged between 20 and 50 cm. Samples in years prior to 1984 were generally of larger fish but had smaller sample sizes than in more recent years. Increases in size can be seen from the early 2000s to approximately 2015, and an influx of smaller sized fish started around 2015. The mean length observed by year shows these patterns more clearly (@fig-lenMean-rec). Fish sizes were larger (around 40 cm) but more variable in the earliest years and declined to around 30 cm in 1990. Starting around 1995, mean length began to increase, and reached a peak slightly below 40 cm in 2013, similar to the trend in commercial lengths. Patterns since 2015 are less clear, though 2024 was a unique year given the regulations prohibiting `r spp` retention. The effect of excluding 2024 length data for the recreational fleet was explored as a sensitivity analysis (see @sec-assmt-sens).


### Abundance Indices

Several data sources were explored for potential indices of abundance representing the recreational fleet. The primary survey data sources for recreational fishing are the \gls{mrfss} and the \gls{crfs}. Both sampling programs conduct angler interviews during dockside sampling for both party/charter and private/rental vessels. The frequency of `r spp` in both the \gls{mrfss} and \gls{crfs} party/charter datasets and the \gls{mrfss} private/rental dataset is insufficient to create indices (see @sec-data-not-used). We also found that the Deb Wilson-Vandenberg onboard observer survey, conducted concurrently with \gls{mrfss}, contained insufficient observations of `r spp` for developing an index. Therefore, the only recreational fishery-dependent index included in the model was a standardized index of abundance modeled using \gls{crfs} private/rental dockside angler interview data.

Catch and effort data from the \gls{crfs} dockside sampling of private/rental boats between 2004 and 2023 were provided by \gls{cdfw} (provided on 12/09/2024). This index represents the longest available time series compared to other indices used for the base model. The data included catch by species, number of anglers contributing to the catch, angler-reported area of fishing, gear, county, port, interview site, year, month, and CRFS district. Ultimately, only data through 2022 were used. See @sec-appendix-A for details on the data filtering, processing, and model selection. The \gls{crfs} private/rental index of abundance was highest in 2006 and has a declining trend through 2022 that is comparable to the value from 2004 (@fig-indices).
